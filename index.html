    <p>Roll to determine how many dice to roll. Players can roll at most 10 small dice and at most 6 special dice. Next dice roll determines RS that can be used for buying, bulding, and advancing. Special dice are rolled to get RS that can only be specifically used for one of these phases. Players can buy resources to build that have a randomly generated cost. Players then build with resources and additional RS. In the advance phase, players intialize players on the board and can advance to spaces with a maximum army of 5 troops per space.</p>
